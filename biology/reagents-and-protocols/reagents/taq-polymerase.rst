Taq DNA ploymerase
======================

.. |degC| unicode:: U+00B0 C
   :ltrim:

.. note::
    The PCR products generated using Taq DNA Polymerase
    contain dA overhangs at the 3´–end; therefore the PCR
    products can be ligated to dT/dU-overhang vectors.


Working Temperature (maybe not optimum): 72 |degC|

Extension Speepd: 1000 bps per 10 seconds.
